    <p>“‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 
    vaccine series as recommended for the best protection against 
    severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No 
    vaccine offers 100% protection against illness, yet it does give 
    you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of 
    being exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”</p>

<h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to 
    others, including other vaccinated people?</h2>
    <p>While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower 
    rate. She adds that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune 
    response to vaccines.</p> 
    <p>“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health 
    disorders may not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. 
    We are still collecting data and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these 
    vulnerable populations.”</p>
